- ✅ Clean build ready for production

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
Three-phase optimization for bundle size and React render efficiency
- ✅ **Phase 3a - Font Optimization:** Added font-display: swap for non-blocking font loading
- ✅ **Phase 3b - Code Splitting:** Implemented manual chunks strategy to separate vendor dependencies by functionality
  - vendor-core: React/Redux Toolkit (360 KB)
  - vendor-ui: Blueprint/react-draggable (472 KB)
  - vendor-apollo: Apollo Client (97 KB)
  - vendor: Other dependencies (1,058 KB)
  - shared-redux: Redux slices (7.6 KB)
- ✅ **Phase 3c - React Optimization:** Memoized caption components and styled components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Wrapped Captions, CaptionsContainer, CaptionText, Pulse with React.memo
  - Memoized ClosedCaption and MobileClosedCaption components

**Performance Gains:**
- App bundle: 26.37 → 19.65 kB (-25.5%)
- Gzip bundle: 8.65 → 6.62 kB (-23.5%)
- Total uncompressed: 2,293 → 1,994.7 kB (-13%)
- Better caching and parallelization with split chunks
